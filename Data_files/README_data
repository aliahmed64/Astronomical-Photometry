# Astronomical Photometry Data file

## Overview

This repository contains the data for the Astronomical Photometry.
## Uploaded Files

- **`AST325-326-SN-filelist.txt`**: This file lists all 433 FITS files used in the project. It provides a comprehensive reference for the data set but does not include the actual FITS files due to size constraints.

## File Size Limitations

Due to the large file size of the FITS files, we are unable to upload the 433 `.egg` files directly to this repository. The size of these files exceeds the capacity limits of GitHub and most other version control systems. Therefore, the FITS files are not included in this repository.

### Alternative Access

If you need access to the FITS files, please contact the course coordinator or refer to the following alternative sources:

- **Course Data Repository**: [Link to Data Source](http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/astrolab/)
- **Alternative File Sharing**: The FITS files may be available through alternative file sharing services or provided upon request.
